# Quiver Library Markdown exporter to Obsidian

![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/quiver-markdown-exporter)

A [Quiver](https://yliansoft.com/) markdown note exporter. I started to use Quiver around 2015 and 2016. But I quickly get back to Evernote. Recently I found [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) quite useful and migrated all of my notes to it. So I write this exporter to migrate my notes from Quiver to Obsidian.

And my Quiver notes only use a subset of Quiver features, so I can't guarantee that the exported notes are the same as the ones in Quiver. But I hope it's enough for you to get started.

Some working features:
